                    I'm a software engineer with a six-year journey through the
                    diverse realms of IT and software development. Starting from
                    hands-on technical support, progressing through software
                    testing and documentation, and advancing into software
                    design and management, I've consistently delivered impactful
                    results.

                    My core strength lies in problem-solving and critical
                    thinking, thriving on intellectually challenging work that
                    involves solving novel problems. Anchored in a value system
                    of honesty, transparency, and accountability, I am known
                    among colleagues for being patient, rational, and logical.
                    This adaptability and collaborative mindset have been
                    crucial in navigating transitions and resolving complex
                    issues.

                    While my current role encompasses designing software, my
                    ambition extends to overseeing the entire processâ€”from
                    feature design to code development. This aspiration prompted
                    my enrollment in General Assembly's Software Engineering
                    Immersive, marking my commitment to becoming a software
                    engineer. Looking forward, I am poised to leverage this
                    background, coupled with my newfound skills, to make
                    impactful strides in software engineering.
